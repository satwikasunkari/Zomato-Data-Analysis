## Project Overview

This project explores Zomato's restaurant data to answer important questions related to restaurant locations, ratings, cuisines, and pricing. It employs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of restaurant locations, ratings, and cuisines
- Insights into pricing trends and top restaurants
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Zomato and may include information such as:

- Restaurant names
- Locations
- Cuisines
- Ratings
- Average cost for two
- Number of votes

> You can find the dataset in the `data/` directory. If not present, please add it or update the path as necessary.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satwikasunkari/Zomato-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Zomato-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file (e.g., `Zomato_EDA.ipynb` or similar) and run the cells.

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis.
- Modify the analysis or add new visualizations as needed.
- Results and insights are displayed in the notebook cells.
